#Regular expressions

#Regular expressions can be thought of as a combination of literals and metacharacters
#To draw an analogy with natural language, think of literal text forming the words of this language, and the metacharacters defining its grammar
#Regular expressions have a rich set of metacharacters

#Literals

#Simplest pattern consists only of literals. The literal “nuclear” would match to the following lines:
  
 # Ooh. I just learned that to keep myself alive after a
#nuclear blast! All I have to do is milk some rats
#then drink the milk. Aweosme. :}

#Laozi says nuclear weapons are mas macho

#Chaos in a country that has nuclear weapons -- not good.

#my nephew is trying to teach me nuclear physics, or
#possibly just trying to show me how smart he is
#so I’ll be proud of him [which I am].

#lol if you ever say "nuclear" people immediately think
#DEATH by radiation LOL

#Literals

#The literal “Obama” would match to the following lines

#Politics r dum. Not 2 long ago Clinton was sayin Obama
#was crap n now she sez vote 4 him n unite? WTF?
 # Screw em both + Mcain. Go Ron Paul!
  
#  Clinton conceeds to Obama but will her followers listen??
  
 # Are we sure Chelsea didn’t vote for Obama?
  
#  thinking ... Michelle Obama is terrific!
  
 # jetlag..no sleep...early mornig to starbux..Ms. Obama
#was moving

#Regular Expressions

#Simplest pattern consists only of literals; a match occurs if the sequence of literals occurs anywhere in the text being tested

#What if we only want the word “Obama”? or sentences that end in the word “Clinton”, or “clinton” or “clinto”?
  
#  Regular Expressions

#We need a way to express

#whitespace word boundaries
#sets of literals
#the beginning and end of a line
#alternatives (“war” or “peace”) Metacharacters to the rescue!
#  Metacharacters

#Some metacharacters represent the start of a line

#^i think
#will match the lines

#i think we all rule for participating
#i think i have been outed
#i think this will be quite fun actually
#i think i need to go to work
#i think i first saw zombo in 1999.
#Metacharacters

#$ represents the end of a line

#morning$
 # will match the lines

#well they had something this morning
#then had to catch a tram home in the morning
#dog obedience school in the morning
#and yes happy birthday i forgot to say it earlier this morning
#I walked in the rain this morning
#good morning
#Character Classes with []

#We can list a set of characters we will accept at a given point in the match

#[Bb][Uu][Ss][Hh]
#will match the lines

#The democrats are playing, "Name the worst thing about Bush!"
#I smelled the desert creosote bush, brownies, BBQ chicken
#BBQ and bushwalking at Molonglo Gorge
#Bush TOLD you that North Korea is part of the Axis of Evil
#I’m listening to Bush - Hurricane (Album Version)
#Character Classes with []

#^[Ii] am

#i am so angry at my boyfriend i can’t even bear to
#look at him

#i am boycotting the apple store

#I am twittering from iPhone

#I am a very vengeful person when you ruin my sweetheart.

#Character Classes with []

#Similarly, you can specify a range of letters [a-z] or [a-zA-Z]; notice that the order doesn’t matter

#^[0-9][a-zA-Z]
#will match the lines

#7th inning stretch
#2nd half soon to begin. OSU did just win something
#3am - cant sleep - too hot still.. :(
 # 5ft 7 sent from heaven

#  Character Classes with []
  
 # When used at the beginning of a character class, the “^” is also a metacharacter and indicates matching characters NOT in the indicated class
  
 # [^?.]$
 #   will match the lines
  
#  i like basketballs
 # 6 and 9
#  dont worry... we all die anyway!
#    Not in Baghdad
